# Playbook Documentation

Playbook is the deterministic repo runtime and trust layer between humans/AI agents and real repositories: deterministic intelligence, governance checks, and reviewed remediation loops.

Playbook is not a general-purpose chat assistant. It is a contract-first runtime for operating safely against production repositories.

## Canonical operating ladder

`ai-context -> ai-contract -> context -> index/query/explain/ask --repo-context -> verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`
