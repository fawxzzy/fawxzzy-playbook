# Playbook Improvement Backlog

## Purpose

This document captures feature ideas, architectural improvements, and workflow opportunities discovered during development.

Items here are **not yet committed roadmap work**.

They are promoted to the roadmap when they become prioritized product capabilities.

This structure prevents roadmap bloat while preserving engineering intelligence discovered during development.

---

## Query System Ideas

- Dependency graph query  
  Command: `playbook query dependencies`

- Impact analysis query enhancements  
  Command: `playbook query impact <module>`

---

## Developer Workflow Intelligence

- Pull request analysis  
  Command: `playbook analyze-pr`

Potential capabilities:

- modules affected by change
- architectural blast radius
- risk score
- missing tests
- documentation coverage gaps

---

## Risk Intelligence Enhancements

- `playbook query risk --top`

Purpose:  
Rank highest-risk modules in the repository.

---

## Follow-up Opportunities

- `playbook backlog audit`

Purpose:  
Automatically detect implemented improvements and archive them.

---

## Docs Governance Follow-ups

- Pattern: Documentation responsibility boundaries should be enforced by moving idea content to the improvement backlog rather than duplicating planning language across docs.
- Rule: `docs/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` should describe current AI operating context, not future feature planning.
- Rule: `docs/PLAYBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md` should describe development process, not act as a second roadmap.
- Rule: `docs/index.md` should navigate documentation, not duplicate backlog or roadmap content.
- Pattern: Historical one-off cleanup docs should be archived or removed once governance rules replace them.
- Failure Mode: Docs-audit warning burn-down is faked if warnings are removed by weakening audit rules instead of aligning documents.

## Future Capability: Repository Memory System

### Motivation

Playbook is evolving toward an AI development operating system where repository intelligence, deterministic remediation, and durable engineering memory work together.

Important engineering knowledge is often lost across chat threads, PR comments, and one-off investigations. A repository memory system would preserve this knowledge as deterministic artifacts that can be queried, audited, and promoted through normal governance workflows.

### Memory artifact direction

Potential structured memory layer:

```text
.playbook/memory/
  decisions.json
  patterns.json
  failure-modes.json
  open-questions.json
```

The intent is to preserve architecture decisions, patterns, failure modes, unresolved questions, module notes, and investigation outcomes as long-lived repository intelligence.

### Conversation-to-knowledge workflow

Playbook should support promoting important conversations into durable artifacts instead of leaving them in ephemeral chat history.

Potential promotion targets:

- structured repository memory entries
- documentation candidates
- improvement backlog entries
- roadmap candidates when prioritized

### Potential future command surface (concept only)

- `playbook memory capture`
- `playbook memory query`
- `playbook memory promote`
- `playbook memory prune`

These command names are directional only and should be treated as backlog concepts, not implemented surface.

### AI workflow + future conversation surface alignment

A future Playbook conversational interface (for example, Playbook Chat) should act as a front-end to deterministic Playbook artifacts and commands rather than bypassing repository intelligence contracts.

This keeps conversational UX grounded in the same deterministic governance/runtime model used by CLI and CI workflows.

- Pattern: Conversation-to-Knowledge Pipeline
  - Important engineering discussions should be promotable into structured repository memory and documentation artifacts.
- Pattern: Durable Engineering Memory
  - Repositories should preserve architectural rationale, decisions, and failure modes as structured artifacts rather than ephemeral conversations.
- Pattern: Repository Memory Layer
  - Playbook may introduce structured memory artifacts to capture decisions, patterns, and investigations across repository evolution.
- Failure Mode: Chat Without Memory
  - Conversational interfaces become shallow if decisions and investigations are not preserved as structured repository knowledge.
