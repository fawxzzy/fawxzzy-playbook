# Playbook Notes

- WHAT changed: Added explicit CI/development governance docs (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md`).
- WHY it changed: Clarifies CI guarantees, local verification workflow, and notes-on-changes expectations for contributors.

- WHAT changed: Tracked `pnpm-lock.yaml` in git and updated CI lockfile failure messaging in `.github/actions/playbook-ci/action.yml`.
- WHY it changed: Fixes frozen-lockfile drift failures by ensuring the lockfile is committed and gives contributors a clear remediation command.
