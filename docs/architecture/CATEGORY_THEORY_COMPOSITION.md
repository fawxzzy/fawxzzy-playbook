# Category Theory Composition for Promotion Decisions

Promotion governance can be modeled as a small category:

- **Objects:** Pattern states (`draft`, `hold`, `review`, `promoted`, `deferred`, `rejected`, `superseded`).
- **Morphisms:** Promotion decisions (`promote`, `defer`, `reject`, `merge`, `split`, `supersede`).
- **Composition:** A morphism may compose only when the codomain of the prior transition matches the domain of the next transition.

## Identity / no-op concept

For reviewed knowledge that remains unchanged, the workflow still emits an explicit decision record (for example a defer/deferred holdover) so replay preserves a deterministic identity-like step in the journal.

## Practical associativity via replay

Associativity is enforced operationally: replaying the same append-only decision journal in deterministic order (`originCycleId`, `sequence`, `timestamp`, `decisionId`) reconstructs the same final pattern states.

## Governance rule set

- **Rule:** No knowledge state may be mutated in place; all durable transitions must be explicit morphisms.
- **Pattern:** Promotion decisions are the compositional algebra of Playbook knowledge governance.
- **Failure Mode:** If decisions are not journaled append-only, composition cannot be replayed and rollback semantics collapse.

## Contract mutation composition

- **Rule:** Contracts evolve only through verified mutation proposals.
- **Pattern:** Pattern promotion feeds contract proposals, not direct contract mutation.
- **Failure Mode:** Direct mutation of contracts breaks deterministic governance.

## Topology-class canonicalization morphism

Pattern topology canonicalization introduces an idempotent compression morphism over promoted pattern objects:

- equivalent promoted pattern cards map into one canonical representative object
- non-canonical members remain valid objects with explicit variant lineage to the canonical object
- canonicalization is deterministic and replayable from invariant-only topology signatures

This keeps structural composition stable while preventing doctrine fragmentation from duplicate canonical structures.


## Reasoning-engine positioning note

This composition model is part of Playbook's reasoning-engine architecture, not a standalone mathematical claim.

- It operationalizes promotion governance as deterministic, replayable state transitions.
- It contributes directly to knowledge governance and self-reflection because decision journals can be inspected to improve future promotion policy.

Novelty boundary:

Playbook does not claim novel raw category theory; it applies established composition concepts as production contracts for engineering knowledge governance.
