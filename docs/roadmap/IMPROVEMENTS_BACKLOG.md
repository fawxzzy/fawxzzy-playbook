# Playbook Improvement Backlog

## Purpose

This document captures feature ideas, architectural improvements, and workflow opportunities discovered during development.

Items here are **not yet committed roadmap work**.

They are promoted to the roadmap when they become prioritized product capabilities.

This structure prevents roadmap bloat while preserving engineering intelligence discovered during development.

## Staging candidates: Product truth packaging and narrative sync

These backlog candidates feed roadmap track `PB-V1-PRODUCT-TRUTH-PACKAGING-001` without implying live command-surface changes in this pass.

- Add a generated command truth table framing commands as canonical workflow, compatibility-only, or utility surfaces.
- Add narrative drift checks that compare runtime/help/docs/demo/roadmap language for planned-vs-live consistency.
- Add explicit `ask --repo-context` question-boundary examples (in-scope and unsupported) for deterministic operator expectations.
- Add demo/onboarding synchronization checks so ladder guidance stays aligned with implemented contracts.

---

## Staging candidates: Knowledge compaction phase follow-through

These backlog candidates align to roadmap track `PB-V08-KNOWLEDGE-COMPACTION-SPEC-001` and remain internal-first.

- Add deterministic canonicalization helpers for candidate pattern normalization (role labels, unstable-token stripping, mechanism summaries).
- Add candidate bucketing contract fixtures (`discard|attach|merge|add`) with deterministic replay tests and deferred generalization metadata only.
- Add pattern-card artifact schema and validation guidance for candidate/reviewed/promoted lifecycle states.
- Add compaction review artifact templates that link candidate abstraction fields to concrete evidence provenance.
- Add docs/rules promotion workflow checks so compaction outputs never imply autonomous promotion.

---

## Staging candidates: Knowledge lifecycle hardening (internal-first)

These candidates establish lifecycle gates before any broad knowledge-management command expansion.

- Define evidence-state contracts that explicitly distinguish observed evidence from compacted knowledge candidates.
- Add deterministic comparison fixtures proving stable candidate matching against existing compacted artifacts.
- Add promotion trust-threshold checklist contracts for reusable pattern/rule/contract elevation.
- Add retirement policies for supersede/deprecate/merge/remove actions on stale or duplicative artifacts.
- Add lifecycle audit checks that fail when observations are promoted without canonicalization+comparison+compaction evidence.

Pattern: Internal-first knowledge lifecycle before public command expansion.
Pattern: Compaction is the trust-preserving bridge between extraction and promotion.
Rule: Promotion must only happen after canonicalization, deterministic comparison, and compaction.
Failure Mode: Promoting raw observations directly into reusable guidance causes duplication and semantic drift.
Failure Mode: Unbounded pattern accumulation turns deterministic intelligence into low-trust memory sprawl.

## Architectural Insight: Deterministic Engineering Reasoning Loop

Playbook commands already form a reusable deterministic reasoning loop for engineering workflows.

Conceptual loop:

Observe
↓
Understand
↓
Diagnose
↓
Plan
↓
Act
↓
Verify
↓
Learn

Current command mapping:

- `index` → observe repository structure
- `query` → inspect architecture metadata
- `ask` / `explain` → understand repository semantics
- `plan` → generate deterministic remediation intent
- `apply` → execute changes
- `verify` → confirm repository compliance
- memory direction (`.playbook/memory/*`) → preserve engineering knowledge

This indicates Playbook is not only a CLI command set. The product is evolving toward a deterministic reasoning runtime for AI-assisted engineering workflows.

This reasoning loop applies across:

- architecture analysis
- remediation workflows
- CI diagnostics
- PR analysis
- repository maintenance

The loop should remain the core execution model independent of interface surface.

- Pattern: Deterministic Engineering Reasoning Loop
  - Playbook commands collectively implement a reusable reasoning cycle (`observe -> understand -> plan -> act -> verify`).
  - This pattern supports complex engineering workflows while preserving deterministic execution contracts.
- Pattern: Interface Follows Runtime
  - CLI, chat interfaces, CI automation, and AI agents should remain thin interfaces over the same Playbook reasoning loop and artifact contracts.
  - Interfaces should not bypass repository intelligence artifacts.
- Failure Mode: Interface-Led Product Drift
  - If new interfaces (UI, chat, agent surfaces) bypass the deterministic command workflow, Playbook loses consistency and trust.
  - All execution surfaces should route through the canonical Playbook reasoning loop.

## Staged Improvement: Storage and Runtime Artifact Hygiene

### Stage 1 — Artifact taxonomy and docs alignment

- Define a single artifact taxonomy across docs: runtime local artifacts, reviewed automation artifacts, and committed demo/contract snapshots.
- Clarify that `.playbook/` is the default runtime artifact home and that local artifacts are gitignored by default unless intentionally promoted.
- Preserve the distinction that `.playbook/demo-artifacts/` contains stable product-facing snapshot contracts/examples.

### Stage 2 — Scan and cache hygiene direction

- Roadmap `.playbookignore` as a focused scan-exclusion mechanism for high-churn/non-source directories (e.g. `node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`, `.next`, build outputs, non-source artifact folders).
- Define local cache policy guidance for cacheable intelligence artifacts under `.playbook/`, including regeneration expectations and commit guidance.

### Stage 3 — Lifecycle and maintenance ergonomics

- Define retention classes for runtime local state, CI artifacts, and committed contract/demo artifacts so lifecycle rules are explicit.
- Explore optional cleanup/doctor visibility for oversized local Playbook state to surface repository hygiene risks early.

Pattern: Runtime Artifacts Live Under `.playbook/`.
Pattern: Demo Artifacts Are Snapshot Contracts, Not General Runtime State.
Rule: Generated runtime artifacts should be gitignored unless intentionally committed as stable contracts/examples.
Rule: Playbook remains local/private-first by default.
Failure Mode: Recommitting regenerated artifacts on every run causes unnecessary repo-history growth and review churn.

## Query System Ideas

- Dependency graph query  
  Command: `playbook query dependencies`

- Impact analysis query enhancements  
  Command: `playbook query impact <module>`

---

## Developer Workflow Intelligence

- Pull request analysis  
  Command: `playbook analyze-pr`

Potential capabilities:

- modules affected by change
- architectural blast radius
- risk score
- missing tests
- documentation coverage gaps

---

## Risk Intelligence Enhancements

- `playbook query risk --top`

Purpose:  
Rank highest-risk modules in the repository.

---

## Follow-up Opportunities

- `playbook backlog audit`

Purpose:  
Automatically detect implemented improvements and archive them.

---

## Docs Governance Follow-ups

- Pattern: Documentation responsibility boundaries should be enforced by moving idea content to the improvement backlog rather than duplicating planning language across docs.
- Rule: `docs/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` should describe current AI operating context, not future feature planning.
- Rule: `docs/PLAYBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md` should describe development process, not act as a second roadmap.
- Rule: `docs/index.md` should navigate documentation, not duplicate backlog or roadmap content.
- Pattern: Historical one-off cleanup docs should be archived or removed once governance rules replace them.
- Failure Mode: Docs-audit warning burn-down is faked if warnings are removed by weakening audit rules instead of aligning documents.

---

## Future Capability Direction: Deterministic Knowledge Lifecycle Runtime

### Positioning

Playbook should evolve as a deterministic engineering intelligence runtime, not as an unbounded repository memory store.

Knowledge growth must be lifecycle-gated:

`observation/extraction -> canonicalization -> deterministic comparison -> bucketing/compaction -> promotion -> retirement`

### Internal-first sequencing

Near-term work should prioritize internal lifecycle contracts/artifacts over new public command families:

- extraction/observation pipelines that preserve evidence provenance
- canonicalization pipelines that normalize candidates into stable comparable shape
- deterministic comparison against compacted artifacts
- compaction/bucketing outcomes (`discard|attach|merge|new candidate`)
- gated promotion into reusable patterns/rules/contracts
- retirement policies for superseded/stale duplicative knowledge

### Public surface stance (explicit)

Potential `playbook knowledge *` commands remain directional concepts only and are intentionally deferred until lifecycle/trust contracts are stable and validated in deterministic workflows.

- Rule: Treat extracted knowledge as evidence first, reusable knowledge second.
- Rule: Promotion requires stronger trust thresholds than observation and must be lifecycle-gated.
- Pattern: Compaction is the bridge between extraction and promotion.
- Failure Mode: Uncontrolled knowledge accumulation degrades determinism, retrieval quality, and operator trust.



## Implemented recently: artifact hygiene and storage governance

The following improvements are now implemented in the command surface:

- Artifact classification model for runtime, automation, and contract artifacts.
- `.playbookignore` scan controls for repository intelligence generation.
- `doctor` artifact hygiene diagnostics and structured suggested fixes.
- `plan`/`apply` remediation IDs for artifact governance workflows (`PB012`, `PB013`, `PB014`).
