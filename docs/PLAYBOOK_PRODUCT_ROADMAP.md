PLAYBOOK – 12 MONTH PRODUCT ROADMAP

Deterministic Repo Runtime and Trust Layer for Software Engineering

MISSION

Build the deterministic runtime and trust layer between humans/AI agents and real repositories.

Playbook ensures repository change workflows:

follows architecture

captures engineering knowledge

maintains documentation discipline

prevents architectural drift

Playbook sits between humans/AI coding agents and repositories as a contract-first operating layer.

Humans + AI Agents

CORE PRINCIPLES

These rules guide all development decisions.

1️⃣ CLI First

Playbook must always function:

locally

offline

inside CI

Cloud must never be required.

playbook init
playbook analyze
playbook verify

must always work independently.

2️⃣ Deterministic Governance

Rules must be:

explicit

predictable

CI-friendly

Avoid "AI guessing" for core enforcement.

CI contract stance:

- `playbook verify --json` is the canonical repository validation gate in CI.
- CI should enforce product correctness, not automation maintenance.
- Maintenance automation (for example `agents:update`, `agents:check`, docs audit) should run in dedicated scheduled/on-demand maintenance workflows.

Failure Mode: If CI mixes product validation with maintenance tasks, pipelines become slow and fragile.

3️⃣ Knowledge Capture

Every meaningful engineering change must produce knowledge.

Example pipeline:

Code change
      ↓
Playbook Notes
      ↓
Proposed Doctrine
      ↓
Promoted Engineering Knowledge

Why this matters

Knowledge capture is governance, not documentation theater. It prevents drift between intent and implementation, enables parallel exploration without losing decision integrity, and turns chat history into structured, reusable engineering knowledge.

4️⃣ Developer Experience Over Features

Adoption depends on:

Install
Run
Understand
Trust

YEAR 1 OBJECTIVE

## Product positioning (current)

Playbook is positioned as **deterministic repo intelligence + governance + safe remediation runtime**:

- deterministic repo intelligence for humans and AI agents
- governance validation through explicit, CI-enforceable contracts
- safe remediation through reviewed `plan -> apply -> verify` loops
- machine-readable command surfaces for automation and integrations

Current implemented product-facing command/artifact set:

- `analyze`
- `verify`
- `rules`
- `doctor`
- `diagram`
- `plan`
- `apply`
- `playbook-demo` artifact (exposed through `playbook demo`)
- `ai-context`
- `ai-contract` (`.playbook/ai-contract.json` handshake contract)
- `doctor --ai` AI-contract readiness gate (deterministic validation of contract + intelligence + remediation surfaces)
- repository intelligence (`index`, `query`, `deps`, `ask`, `explain`)
- deterministic architectural risk intelligence (`playbook query risk <module>`)
- deterministic documentation coverage intelligence (`playbook query docs-coverage [module]`)
- deterministic rule ownership intelligence (`playbook query rule-owners [rule-id]`)
- deterministic module ownership intelligence (`playbook query module-owners [module]`)
- deterministic test hotspot intelligence (`playbook query test-hotspots`) for candidate-only optimization discovery in validation workflows
- deterministic architecture guardrail audits (`playbook audit architecture`) for platform hardening coverage

## Roadmap framing (current baseline + future enhancements)

Use `docs/roadmap/IMPROVEMENTS_BACKLOG.md` as the staging area for emerging ideas, and keep this roadmap focused on prioritized product capabilities.

Pattern: Single Strategic Roadmap

Only one roadmap exists in the repository: `docs/PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`.
All idea-level planning belongs in `docs/roadmap/IMPROVEMENTS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Roadmap-as-contract

Machine-readable roadmap commitments are maintained in `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.json`. CI validates this contract and enforces feature ID references for pull requests in CI contexts.

## Product Development Lifecycle

Playbook features follow a structured lifecycle:

Idea
↓
Improvement Backlog
↓
Roadmap
↓
Implemented
↓
Archived

This keeps the roadmap focused on active commitments while preserving product intelligence discovered during development.

## Backlog Rotation Strategy

The improvement backlog should remain manageable.

When the backlog grows large, completed items should be archived.

Example structure:

```text
docs/
  PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md
  roadmap/
    IMPROVEMENTS_BACKLOG.md
  archive/
    PLAYBOOK_IMPROVEMENTS_2026.md
```

Archived items preserve historical product intelligence without cluttering the active backlog.

Current baseline:

- **AI Repository Intelligence (`playbook ai-context`, `playbook ai-contract`, `index`, `query`, `deps`, `ask`, `explain`)** is implemented and available for deterministic AI bootstrap and repository intelligence workflows.
- `playbook ask` now supports deterministic response modes (`--mode normal|concise|ultra`) to match explanation depth to developer workflow speed.
- `playbook ask --repo-context` now hydrates ask prompts from trusted Playbook artifacts (`.playbook/repo-index.json` + AI contract metadata) instead of broad ad-hoc repository inference.

Future roadmap work should focus on enhancement quality (schema hardening, richer index coverage, CI artifact workflows, and contract durability), not on introducing these commands.

## Platform Hardening

Playbook’s long-term reliability depends on deterministic repository artifacts powering higher-level intelligence commands.

Priority hardening tracks:

1. **Artifact schema versioning + evolution governance**
   - enforce and test schemaVersion coverage for persisted artifacts
   - formalize compatibility and migration policy in contract docs
   - require CI mismatch behavior to remain deterministic and actionable

2. **SCM context abstraction**
   - introduce shared SCM normalization module (`packages/core/src/scm/context.ts`)
   - align merge-base, detached HEAD, shallow clone, dirty tree, and rename behavior across command surfaces
   - add edge-case contract tests for PR vs push contexts

3. **Remediation trust model enforcement**
   - encode Level 0-3 change-scope boundaries into plan/apply contracts
   - keep Level 3 cross-module/security-sensitive changes human-reviewed by default
   - expand remediation safety telemetry for CI auditing

4. **Ecosystem adapter boundaries**
   - isolate external tooling integrations behind deterministic adapter interfaces
   - prevent tool-specific behavior from leaking into engine-level command logic
   - harden adapter error normalization and version-compatibility checks

5. **Context efficiency strategy**
   - strengthen index-once/query-many behavior with incremental indexing direction
   - prioritize module/diff scoped responses and concise deterministic outputs
   - track token/latency budgets for high-frequency command paths

6. **Repeatable architecture guardrail audits**
   - run `playbook audit architecture` as a deterministic hardening diagnostic
   - keep audit checks aligned with docs/contracts/roadmap surfaces
   - enforce stable JSON contract coverage for architecture audit automation

## Product Direction: Architecture Intelligence

Playbook is evolving from a verification tool into an architecture intelligence engine.

In addition to enforcing rules and generating remediation plans, Playbook will analyze repositories and development workflows to produce structured insights about system architecture, risk, and change impact.

Key capabilities in this direction include:

- Repository indexing and query system
- Architecture-aware impact analysis
- Risk hotspot detection
- Pull request intelligence and analysis
- Durable engineering memory direction (`.playbook/memory/*`) to preserve decisions, rationale, and investigation history as queryable repository intelligence for richer AI reasoning.
- Playbook command surfaces already implement a reusable deterministic engineering reasoning loop (`observe -> understand -> diagnose -> plan -> act -> verify -> learn`) that should remain the core execution model across CLI, CI, and future interface layers.

## Product Direction: Knowledge Distillation Engine

Playbook is evolving from repository verification/intelligence into a **Knowledge Distillation Engine** for software engineering.

This architectural direction unifies repository intelligence, context compression, read/change runtime behavior, and the repository learning loop under a recursive intelligence model while preserving the canonical execution model (`observe -> understand -> diagnose -> plan -> act -> verify -> learn`).

Recursive intelligence cycle:

`observe -> detect repetition -> extract candidate patterns -> generalize into rules/invariants -> compress into reusable artifacts -> reuse during repository reasoning and remediation -> learn from outcomes`

Repository evidence sources for distillation:

- source code
- repository structure
- dependency graphs
- documentation
- pull request diffs
- verify findings
- plan/apply histories
- CI failures
- rule violations
- ownership metadata
- architecture metadata

Architecture principle:

Atomic knowledge is **layer-relative** rather than globally fixed.

Layer-relative knowledge units:

- **syntax layer**: tokens, symbols, AST nodes
- **structure layer**: files, modules, dependencies, ownership edges
- **behavior layer**: findings, failures, fixes, remediation actions
- **semantic layer**: rules, doctrines, invariants, constraints
- **compressed runtime layer**: digests, bundles, graph summaries, reusable intelligence artifacts

Pattern: Intelligence via Recursive Compression.
- Playbook should continuously transform repository evidence into increasingly reusable and compact knowledge representations.

Pattern: Layer-Relative Knowledge Units.
- The unit of knowledge depends on the active reasoning layer rather than being globally fixed.

Rule: Compression Must Preserve Explanatory Power.
- A compressed representation is only valid if it still explains repository behavior, boundaries, and architecture meaningfully.

Pattern: Human-Reviewed Knowledge Promotion.
- Repeated patterns may generate candidate rules, doctrines, or invariants, but promotion into enforced governance requires explicit review.

Failure Mode: Premature Canonicalization.
- Forcing one universal knowledge atom too early destroys useful intermediate representations.

Failure Mode: Compression Without Semantics.
- Token reduction without preserved meaning produces weak and unsafe repository intelligence.

## Integration Architecture Direction: shared core, local intelligence

### Consumer Integration Contract

`docs/CONSUMER_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` defines the formal downstream integration model for installing Playbook in external repositories.

Goals:

- define shared core vs project-local intelligence
- prevent forks
- enable safe downstream adoption
- support future embedded runtime/API integrations

Canonical model for downstream adoption:

- **Shared core product/engine:** Playbook CLI/engine/contracts remain the reusable upstream product surface.
- **Project-local Playbook state:** each consuming repository owns its own local Playbook state (`playbook.config.json` / `.playbook/*` index/artifacts/plans and repository-specific rules/extensions).
- **Installing Playbook is not a fork by default:** adding Playbook to a repository creates local integration state built on shared core.

### Private-first intelligence model

- scanning/indexing/artifacts remain local by default
- no automatic upstream code/content sharing
- any export/sync/cloud/telemetry behavior is future work and must be explicit + opt-in

### Runtime artifact boundaries and storage hygiene direction

Playbook should maintain explicit boundaries between local runtime state, reviewed automation outputs, and intentionally committed contracts/examples.

- Runtime artifacts should live under `.playbook/` and be treated as local working state by default.
- Regenerated runtime artifacts should not be recommitted on every run unless intentionally promoted to stable contracts/examples.
- Demo artifacts committed under `.playbook/demo-artifacts/` remain product-facing snapshot contracts, not general runtime state.
- Future repository intelligence scanning should exclude irrelevant and high-churn directories to keep indexing deterministic and focused on source-of-truth content.

Pattern: Runtime Artifacts Live Under `.playbook/`.
Pattern: Demo Artifacts Are Snapshot Contracts, Not General Runtime State.
Rule: Generated runtime artifacts should be gitignored unless intentionally committed as stable contracts/examples.
Rule: Playbook remains local/private-first by default.
Failure Mode: Recommitting regenerated artifacts on every run causes unnecessary repo-history growth and noisy diffs.

Roadmap direction: introduce a scoped `.playbookignore` mechanism (future work) to exclude irrelevant/high-churn directories such as `node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`, `.next`, build outputs, and non-source artifact folders from repository intelligence scans when appropriate.


### Intentional upstream promotion workflow

- repository-specific observations stay local to the consuming repo
- reusable patterns, generalized rules, and product gaps are promoted upstream intentionally
- downstream usage informs Playbook through explicit docs/roadmap/rule promotion workflows, not hidden mutation

### Extension model preference

Pattern: **config/plugins/rule packs over forks** for project-specific customization.

Failure mode: treating per-project customization as core forks causes drift, duplicate fixes, and unclear ownership boundaries.

### Embeddable runtime/API direction (future)

For app-integrated actions (internal dashboards, CI control planes, admin/dev panels), Playbook should expose server-side/library surfaces over time.

- browser clients should call validated server endpoints/actions
- avoid raw browser-side arbitrary command execution as the default model
- retain deterministic governance and policy checks server-side

### Follow-up implementation checklist (roadmap slices)

- [x] publish a consumer-repo integration contract doc that defines project-local Playbook state boundaries
- [ ] add a lightweight config/plugin/rule-pack architecture note with extension examples
- [ ] draft first server-side library/API design stub for embedded `ask`/`query`/`explain` workflows
- [x] add `ask --module <name>` scoped repo-context hydration
- [x] add `ask --diff-context` for change-scoped intelligence prompts
- [x] expose ask context-source provenance contract in JSON for app/agent integrations
- [ ] define explicit opt-in export/sync/telemetry policy language before any cloud-backed intelligence behavior

### Storage/runtime hygiene follow-up checklist

Implemented baseline:

- `doctor` emits Playbook Artifact Hygiene diagnostics and structured suggestions (`PB012`, `PB013`, `PB014`).
- `index` and repository scans honor `.playbookignore` for scan exclusions.
- `plan`/`apply` integrate artifact hygiene remediation tasks for deterministic storage governance.

- [x] define `.playbookignore` semantics for repository intelligence scanning and document default exclusion guidance.
- [x] publish artifact lifecycle/retention policy language across runtime artifacts, CI outputs, and committed demo/contract snapshots.
- [x] classify cacheable local intelligence artifacts under `.playbook/` and define safe regeneration expectations.
- [x] document CI artifact workflow guidance so generated artifacts are reviewable without creating long-term repository-history bloat.

Rule: **Playbook analyzes but does not author.**

Playbook provides structured analysis, diagnostics, and recommendations but does not automatically rewrite pull requests or developer intent. Its role is to provide architectural intelligence rather than replace the developer.


Establish Playbook as a trusted governance tool in the developer ecosystem.

Target outcomes:

1,000+ GitHub stars
100+ repositories using Playbook in CI
First external contributors
Initial enterprise interest

Revenue is not the priority during Year 1.

Adoption is.

## Roadmap Compounding Audit (Planning Baseline)

This section records a structural planning audit to keep roadmap phases compounding, non-overlapping, and AI-runtime ready.

### Executive Summary

Strengths:
- CLI-first and deterministic-governance principles are explicit and consistent with the product mission.
- Repository intelligence is already positioned as a machine-readable substrate and is connected to AI/CI workflows.
- The canonical remediation flow (`verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`) is repeatedly reinforced.

Weaknesses:
- Read-runtime capabilities (`ask`, `query`, `explain`, PR analysis) and change-runtime capabilities (`verify`, `plan`, `apply`) are interleaved across phases, which blurs sequencing.
- Context-compression mechanisms are present but not modeled as a dedicated architectural layer.
- Several phases overlap in scope (`query`, dependency graph, impact, risk) rather than compounding as a single intelligence maturation track.
- AI execution runtime planning appears before all mutation-safety and deterministic patch-scope prerequisites are clearly gated.

### Roadmap Structural Issues

Overlapping phase concerns:
- Query, dependency graph, impact analysis, and risk analysis are spread across separate phases with shared substrate dependencies.
- Context compression appears as a standalone subsection between phases rather than a formal phase with explicit contracts.
- PR intelligence is implemented but documented outside the core phase ladder, despite being a read-runtime capability.

Unclear boundaries:
- The roadmap mixes capability introduction (new layer) and capability enhancement (quality expansion) inside the same phase descriptions.
- AI execution runtime planning overlaps with autonomous maintenance and security-program mutation controls.

Sequencing issues:
- Repository intelligence formalization should complete before read/change runtime specialization.
- Deterministic mutation scope, path boundaries, and policy gates should be marked as explicit prerequisites before broad agent runtime expansion.

### Recommended Phase Structure

Use a layered phase model so each phase compounds directly on the previous one:

1. **Phase 1 — CLI Foundations**  
   Deterministic command contracts, distribution reliability, and baseline verification UX.
2. **Phase 2 — Repository Intelligence Substrate**  
   Formalize index contracts for modules, dependencies, test relationships, docs mapping, ownership, and architecture metadata.
3. **Phase 3 — Repository Knowledge Graph**  
   Deterministic local graph substrate generated from repository intelligence artifacts.
4. **Phase 4 — Context Compression Layer**  
   Context bundles, module digests, cached snapshots, and deterministic change-scope assembly.
5. **Phase 5 — Read Runtime (Query / Explain / Ask / Analyze-PR)**  
   Deterministic architecture reasoning and read-only repository understanding flows.
6. **Phase 6 — Change Runtime (Verify / Plan / Apply)**  
   Deterministic remediation orchestration with explicit plan contracts and mutation boundaries.
7. **Phase 7 — Risk-Aware Execution**  
   Risk signals, impact-aware sequencing, and risk-shaped remediation prioritization.
8. **Phase 8 — AI Repository Contract**  
   Machine-readable AI-operability contract and enforcement rules.
9. **Phase 9 — AI Execution Runtime**  
   Agent orchestration that consumes repository intelligence + AI contract and obeys deterministic mutation workflow.
10. **Phase 10 — Autonomous Maintenance (Policy-Gated)**  
   Recurring maintenance execution modes with approval and policy controls.
11. **Phase 11 — Repository Learning Loop (Human-Reviewed)**  
   Pattern detection and candidate improvements from repeated findings/remediations/query usage, including pattern mining from repeated findings, remediation clustering, candidate rule synthesis, invariant discovery, doctrine promotion candidates, memory compaction, and graph-informed learning artifacts. Outputs remain candidate knowledge artifacts until human review promotes them to enforced governance.

Reasoning for reordering:
- Separates repository understanding (read runtime) from repository mutation (change runtime).
- Makes intelligence and context efficiency foundational before AI runtime expansion.
- Ensures advanced automation is gated by deterministic contracts and mutation safety.

### Missing Capabilities to Formalize

The roadmap should make these explicit as first-class contracts:
- module digests for compact architecture context transfer
- minimal change-scope bundles for patch targeting
- deterministic mutation scope declaration (`allowedFiles`, patch-size constraints, boundary checks)
- risk-aware context shaping (high-risk modules get richer context; low-risk modules stay concise)
- cache lifecycle policy for `.playbook/context/*` intelligence snapshots

### Token Efficiency Opportunities

To reduce scan cost and AI tokens:
- make `index` + cached intelligence artifacts the default source for read runtime operations
- require context bundles for agent workflows instead of broad repository scans
- add deterministic module digests as lightweight context payloads for `ask`/`explain`
- persist change-scope bundles that include files/tests/dependencies/docs/rules/risk in one contract
- enforce patch-scope narrowing before generation to reduce reasoning breadth

### Architecture Patterns

- Pattern: One intelligence substrate powering multiple task runtimes.
- Pattern: Read runtime and change runtime are distinct execution modes with shared contracts.
- Pattern: Context compression is a product layer, not an ad-hoc optimization.
- Pattern: Contract-driven AI execution with deterministic mutation boundaries.
- Pattern: Risk-aware context shaping to balance safety and token efficiency.

### Failure Modes

- Failure Mode: Feature accumulation without layer boundaries.
- Failure Mode: Treating read and mutation tasks as the same runtime path.
- Failure Mode: Context bloat from repeated full-repo scans.
- Failure Mode: Agent/runtime expansion before mutation-safety prerequisites are complete.
- Failure Mode: Intelligence drift when index/schema ownership is distributed across unrelated phases.

### Recommended Documentation Reorganization (this file)

Rewrite/reorganize these sections in `docs/PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`:
- Consolidate **PHASE 2**, **PHASE 3**, **PHASE 4**, **PHASE 5**, **PHASE 6**, and **PHASE 7** into a clear progression: substrate -> knowledge graph -> context compression -> read runtime -> change runtime -> risk-aware execution.
- Keep **AI Efficiency & Context Compression** as an explicit numbered phase.
- Move **PR Intelligence (Implemented)** under the read-runtime phase grouping.
- Add an explicit "Phase 9 prerequisites" block requiring deterministic mutation scope, policy gates, and contract validation before `playbook agent` expansion.
- Add a future **Repository Learning Loop** phase scoped to human-reviewed suggestions only (no autonomous mutation).

### Documentation Capture Rules (Post-Audit)

Roadmap documentation must preserve these architectural statements:
- Read workflows and change workflows are separate runtimes sharing one repository-intelligence substrate.
- Persistent repository intelligence is the default mechanism for reducing AI token usage.
- Context compression and deterministic mutation scope are core AI-efficiency and safety mechanisms.
- Future phases should prioritize intelligence quality and contract durability over command-surface growth.
- A repository learning loop can propose rule/context improvements from observed patterns, with human review required.

PHASE 1 — CLI FOUNDATIONS

Goal:
Ship a reliable local-first CLI with deterministic contracts for human and machine workflows.

Core outcomes:
- Build and distribution reliability (`pnpm -r build`, npm packaging, CI install paths).
- Stable command registry and deterministic JSON outputs.
- Verification-first baseline (`verify`, `plan`, `apply`) for governance enforcement.

PHASE 2 — REPOSITORY INTELLIGENCE

Goal:
Build deterministic repository intelligence artifacts that AI systems and developers can trust.

Primary capability:
- `playbook index` generates `.playbook/repo-index.json` as machine-readable repository context.

Intelligence artifacts should include:
- modules
- dependencies
- dependents
- architecture metadata

PHASE 3 — REPOSITORY KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

Goal:
Build a deterministic local Repository Knowledge Graph artifact from repository intelligence.

Primary capability:
- `playbook index` emits `.playbook/repo-graph.json` as a local, deterministic, CLI-first graph artifact generated from repository evidence.
- Graph artifact evolution is versioned by explicit contract policy with additive-vs-breaking guidance for downstream CI/AI consumers.

Graph architecture stance:
- local
- deterministic
- CLI-first
- generated from repository evidence
- canonical context source for reasoning/runtime flows

Initial graph concepts:

Nodes:
- repository
- module
- file
- function
- test
- rule
- doc
- owner
- finding
- plan task
- risk signal

Edges:
- depends_on
- contained_in
- defines
- calls
- verified_by
- governed_by
- owned_by
- violates
- remediates
- impacts

Repository Knowledge Graph should power:
- context compression
- impact analysis
- risk-aware reasoning
- future pattern mining / repository learning loops
- higher-signal `ask` / `query` / `explain` inputs

Current stabilization direction:
- favor additive read-runtime enrichment (query/explain graph neighborhood summaries)
- avoid broad new graph command families when existing command surfaces can absorb deterministic summaries
- add only low-cost deterministic relationships derivable from indexed repository truth (`contains`, `depends_on`, `governed_by`)

PHASE 4 — AI EFFICIENCY & CONTEXT COMPRESSION

Goal:
Reduce AI cost/latency while increasing knowledge reuse quality for repository reasoning and remediation.

Compression in this phase is both token-efficiency and representation compaction for reusable repository knowledge.

Examples of compressed artifacts:
- module digests
- change-scope bundles
- graph neighborhood summaries
- repeated remediation clusters
- candidate invariant summaries

Key mechanisms:
- repository intelligence graph summaries
- context bundles
- cached context snapshots
- deterministic patch scope

PHASE 5 — QUERY SYSTEM

Goal:
Enable deterministic repository reasoning through command-surface intelligence queries.

Primary capability:
- `playbook query`

Representative queries:
- `playbook query architecture`
- `playbook query dependencies <module>`
- `playbook query impact <module>`
- `playbook query risk <module>`
- `playbook query docs-coverage`
- `playbook query rule-owners`
- `playbook query test-hotspots`

This phase establishes contract-driven repository reasoning so AI systems can avoid ad-hoc inference.

### Impact Analysis Query

Command:
`playbook query impact <module>`

Purpose:
Identify all modules, packages, and files affected by changes to a specific module.

Example:

`playbook query impact auth`

Output:

- dependent modules
- affected rules
- architecture boundaries touched

PHASE 6 — DEPENDENCY GRAPH + IMPACT ANALYSIS

Goal:
Use repository dependency edges to make change impact deterministic.

Primary capabilities:
- dependency graph in index artifacts
- impact analysis via `playbook query impact <module>`

Expected outcomes:
- identify downstream dependents before edits
- expose architectural blast radius for proposed changes
- prioritize low-impact remediation paths first

PHASE 7 — RISK ANALYSIS

Goal:
Add deterministic module-level risk scoring for safer AI and human remediation planning.

Primary capability:
- `playbook query risk <module>`

Risk model signals should include:
- fan-in
- fan-out
- verification failures
- dependency-hub status

Expected outcome:
- safer prioritization of change sequencing and rollout planning.

PHASE 8 — AI REPOSITORY CONTRACT

Status: **Baseline implemented** via `playbook ai-contract` and `.playbook/ai-contract.json`.

Goal:
Define a deterministic, machine-readable AI interaction contract that repositories expose before agent runtime execution is introduced.

Primary capability:
- `.playbook/ai-contract.json`
- `playbook ai-contract` / `playbook ai-contract --json`

The AI Contract specifies how AI systems should interact with a Playbook-governed repository.

Contract fields include:
- AI runtime used
- repository workflow
- repository intelligence sources
- remediation workflow rules

Example contract:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "kind": "playbook-ai-contract",
  "ai_runtime": "playbook-agent",
  "workflow": ["index", "query", "plan", "apply", "verify"],
  "intelligence_sources": {
    "repoIndex": ".playbook/repo-index.json",
    "moduleOwners": ".playbook/module-owners.json"
  },
  "remediation": {
    "canonicalFlow": ["verify", "plan", "apply", "verify"],
    "diagnosticAugmentation": ["explain"]
  },
  "rules": {
    "requireIndexBeforeQuery": true,
    "preferPlaybookCommandsOverAdHocInspection": true,
    "allowDirectEditsWithoutPlan": false
  }
}
```

AI-operable repository signal:
- Repositories containing `.playbook/ai-contract.json` are treated as AI-operable through Playbook governance.
- AI systems should consult this contract before making or proposing code changes.

This phase formalizes Playbook's repository-to-AI protocol, ensuring AI behavior is deterministic and governance-aware.

Future standardization direction:
- Publish `docs/AI_CONTRACT_SPEC.md` as a public AI Contract specification for AI-operable repositories.

PHASE 9 — AI EXECUTION RUNTIME (PLAYBOOK AGENT)

Goal:
Introduce **Playbook Agent** as an AI execution runtime for repositories.

New command:
- `playbook agent`

Vision:
Instead of AI systems directly editing code without guardrails, Playbook Agent orchestrates deterministic repository workflows so every proposal runs through repository intelligence and remediation contracts.

Agent contract relationship:
- Playbook Agent consumes `.playbook/ai-contract.json` to determine repository workflow and operating rules.

Example agent bootstrap flow:
1. AI system enters repository.
2. Detects `.playbook/ai-contract.json`.
3. Loads Playbook workflow/intelligence/remediation rules from the contract.
4. Executes the deterministic `plan -> apply -> verify` loop.

Example:
- `playbook agent "add pagination to workouts API"`

Deterministic AI execution loop:
1. `playbook index`
2. `playbook query architecture`
3. `playbook query dependencies <module>`
4. `playbook query risk <module>`
5. `playbook plan`
6. `playbook apply`
7. `playbook verify`
8. Repeat remediation cycle until verify is clean.

This phase defines Playbook as an AI governance and execution runtime, not only a repository rule checker.

## PR Intelligence (Implemented)

Playbook provides structured deterministic analysis of pull requests/branch diffs to help developers understand architectural impact and risk.

Primary command:

`playbook analyze-pr --json`
`playbook analyze-pr --format github-comment`
`playbook analyze-pr --format github-review`

Current capabilities:

- Detect changed files and affected indexed modules from local git diff
- Derive downstream module impact and architecture boundaries touched
- Aggregate risk signals from existing module-risk intelligence
- Surface docs review candidates and ownership-aware context
- Emit stable machine-readable PR analysis output for automation
- Export deterministic GitHub-ready PR summary markdown via formatter mode (`--format github-comment`) without introducing new analysis logic
- Export deterministic GitHub inline review diagnostics via formatter mode (`--format github-review`) from canonical analysis findings
- Standardize analyze-pr output selection through a single formatter layer (`--format text|json|github-comment|github-review`) so new presentation paths replace superseded ad-hoc branches
- Wire GitHub Actions PR transport to post/update one sticky Playbook summary comment using the canonical `--format github-comment` formatter output (marker: `<!-- playbook:analyze-pr-comment -->`)
- Wire GitHub Actions PR transport to synchronize inline review diagnostics using canonical `--format github-review` output (marker: `<!-- playbook:analyze-pr-inline -->`) so resolved diagnostics disappear
- Treat index generation as an explicit prerequisite in CI (`playbook index` producer before `analyze-pr` consumer) to avoid artifact-readiness drift
- Treat PR diff base as an explicit CI contract (`--base origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` + `fetch-depth: 0`) instead of implicit environment inference

Playbook should analyze PRs but not author them.

Rule: **Playbook analyzes changes rather than rewriting developer intent.**

PHASE 10 — AUTONOMOUS REPOSITORY MAINTENANCE

Goal:
Extend Playbook Agent into recurring and CI-driven repository maintenance modes.

Planned operating modes:
- CI self-healing: `playbook agent --fix-ci`
- maintenance mode: `playbook agent --mode maintain`

Example autonomous tasks:
- documentation drift fixes
- architecture corrections
- rule remediation
- dependency cleanup
- targeted coupling reduction/refactoring flows

Documentation patterns to enforce in this phase:

- Pattern: Contract-Driven AI Execution
  - AI systems must operate through deterministic repository workflows instead of directly modifying code.
- Pattern: AI Execution Loop
  - AI change proposals pass through `plan -> apply -> verify` cycles until repository verification succeeds.
- Pattern: Repository Intelligence Layer
  - Structured repository artifacts (index, dependency graph, risk graph) allow AI tools to reason about codebases deterministically.

Updated product direction:
Playbook evolves from a repository rule checker into an AI-aware repository governance and execution runtime.

Key product pillars:
- Repository intelligence
- Deterministic remediation
- AI-safe execution
- Architecture enforcement


## Security Program

Security is a first-class product program for Playbook and is implemented as deterministic, automated process—not manual review.

### Deterministic Mutation Architecture

Playbook is evolving toward a deterministic and secure repository mutation engine, not just a command runner. The canonical mutation workflow is:

`verify -> plan -> approval -> apply -> verify`

This execution pipeline preserves both automation and control:

- `verify` identifies structural, architectural, or policy failures in deterministic rule output.
- `plan` generates evidence-linked remediation proposals tied to concrete findings.
- `approval` provides a policy and review checkpoint for humans and/or CI before writes occur.
- `apply` executes only validated remediation tasks from the approved plan contract.
- final `verify` confirms repository health after mutations are applied.

Playbook intentionally separates analysis (`verify`), planning (`plan`), and execution (`apply`) so automated repository changes remain reviewable, policy-gated, and reproducible.

### 1️⃣ Execution Safety (Highest Priority)

Secure the core lifecycle:

`index → query/ask/explain → verify → plan → validate → policy → apply → verify`

Key guarantees:

- repo-root boundary enforcement
- deterministic file targeting
- no unreviewed writes
- diff-based remediation only
- policy-gated apply
- evidence-linked plans
- no arbitrary command execution

Roadmap milestones:

- [ ] repo path normalization and traversal protection
- [ ] symlink escape prevention
- [ ] patch size and scope limits
- [ ] file write allowlists
- [ ] remediation plan validation layer
- [ ] policy engine gate before apply
- [ ] deterministic remediation contracts with strict schema + task invariants

### 2️⃣ Release and Supply Chain Integrity

Ensure Playbook releases are verifiable and tamper-resistant.

Roadmap milestones:

- [ ] SBOM generation for every build
- [ ] dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] secret scanning in CI
- [ ] Sigstore/Cosign artifact signing
- [ ] provenance attestations
- [ ] immutable releases
- [ ] protected CI pipelines

Automated artifacts:

- `/artifacts/sbom.json`
- `/artifacts/provenance.json`
- `/artifacts/signature.cosign`

### 3️⃣ Self-Auditing Security Features

Playbook will provide built-in deterministic security intelligence via the same query/verify engine contracts.

Planned command surface:

- `playbook query vulnerabilities`
- `playbook query secrets`
- `playbook query risky-exec`
- `playbook query unsafe-paths`
- `playbook verify security-baseline`

Documentation patterns and rules to encode:

- Rule — No Unreviewed Writes: Playbook must never modify repository files without a diff-based plan and explicit apply step.
- Rule — Repo Root Security Boundary: all file reads and writes must resolve within the repository root.
- Pattern — Policy-Gated Remediation: `finding → plan → validation → policy → apply → verify`.
- Pattern — Evidence-Bound Outputs: plans must reference deterministic findings and source evidence.
- Failure Mode — Prompt Poisoning via Repository Content: repository text is untrusted evidence and must not influence runtime policy behavior.
- Failure Mode — Boundary Drift: new commands must not expand file access scope without explicit security review.
- Rule — Roadmap Automation Check: every new CLI command must include a security verification checklist (path boundary protection, deterministic outputs, plan/apply compatibility, and snapshot tests).

FUTURE DIRECTION — PLAYBOOK PLATFORM VISION

Playbook starts as a CLI-first developer tool, but the platform is intentionally architected so the same analysis engine can power multiple product surfaces.

Architecture Philosophy

packages/engine is the core analysis engine.

Interfaces built on top of it can include:

CLI
GitHub Actions
API services
Web dashboards

This separation allows Playbook to grow from a local CLI workflow into a broader engineering governance platform without fragmenting core logic.

Potential Long-Term Capabilities

- Repository architecture graphs
- Engineering governance scoring
- Cross-repository insights
- Playbook Cloud dashboards
- AI-assisted repository explanation

LONG TERM VISION

Playbook becomes the governance infrastructure for AI-assisted development.

Equivalent ecosystem role:

Git → version control
CI → builds
Sentry → runtime errors
Playbook → architecture governance

FOCUS MANTRA

Every feature must answer one question:

How do we keep AI-generated code aligned with architecture?


## Phase: AI Repository Intelligence (Current + Next Enhancements)

This phase is now implemented in the current product baseline.

Implemented baseline: `playbook index` (paired with `query`, `deps`, `ask`, `explain`, and `ai-context`).

- Command intent: generate a machine-readable repository intelligence artifact for AI-safe repository understanding.
- Output path: `.playbook/repo-index.json`.
- Current index coverage:
  - modules
  - dependencies
  - database schema
  - framework
  - architecture contracts
- Product purpose: enable AI agents to safely understand repository structure and constraints before making code changes.
- Next enhancements: richer intelligence coverage, schema hardening, and stronger CI artifact workflows.

## Phase: AI-Operable Repository Platform (Loop 1 Complete)

Status: the first remediation interface loop is now implemented via `verify`, `plan`, and `apply`.

Canonical flow:

`verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`

- `verify` detects deterministic governance findings.
- `plan` emits deterministic remediation intent (`tasks`) in both human and machine-readable forms.
- `apply` executes deterministic auto-fixable tasks from fresh planning or a serialized `--from-plan` artifact.
- `fix` remains as a convenience/direct remediation path, while `plan` + `apply` is the primary automation contract.

Pattern: **Reviewed Intent Before Execution**

The safest automation model is to generate a machine-readable plan, review it, then execute that exact artifact.

Pattern: **Two-tier backlog (Improvement Backlog → Roadmap)**.

Use `docs/PLAYBOOK_IMPROVEMENTS.md` to capture emerging ideas; promote only prioritized capabilities into this roadmap.

## Phase: Serialized Execution Contracts & Automation Hardening (Next)

Focus this subphase on contract durability for CI and agent integrations:

- [ ] `apply --from-plan` parity hardening across text/json modes and failure reporting.
- [ ] Stable task IDs and schema hardening for long-lived artifact compatibility.
- [ ] Handler registry hardening so unsupported/failed handlers are explicit and auditable.
- [ ] CI/GitHub Action artifact workflows for exporting, reviewing, and applying plan artifacts across steps/jobs.

Failure mode to avoid: **Apply recomputes intent during artifact execution**

If `apply --from-plan` silently re-runs planning logic and diverges from the reviewed artifact, the execution contract is no longer trustworthy.

## Future Capability Track: Automation Synthesis / Playbook Agent

Detailed product direction: see `docs/AUTOMATION_SYNTHESIS_VISION.md`.

Goal:
Extend Playbook from deterministic remediation into a future **Automation Synthesis** platform that can propose and safely operationalize recurring engineering automations without bypassing governance.

Why this matters:
- Teams repeatedly perform the same operational and repository maintenance work.
- Capturing these repeats as reviewed automations reduces toil while preserving policy, explainability, and repository safety.
- Playbook can reuse its existing contract-first execution model so synthesized automation remains reviewable and deterministic rather than opaque agent behavior.

Core concept:
- detect recurring work signals (for example from verify/plan/apply history and approved remediation patterns)
- classify work into known automation patterns/templates
- synthesize candidate automation logic and runbooks
- treat generated automations as untrusted until verified in isolated sandboxes
- route verified candidates through explicit approval gates before deployment to orchestration backends
- monitor runtime behavior with rollback-ready controls

Foundational requirements:
- deterministic contracts for automation definitions, approvals, and execution states
- reusable template and policy packs tied to docs-backed governance behavior
- sandboxed verification before any production orchestration action
- human-reviewable outputs (diffs, risk summaries, and execution intent)
- security-first approval and deployment boundaries aligned with existing apply safety model

Likely phased implementation sequence:
1. **Signal + Pattern Layer**: capture recurring work telemetry and map it to stable Automation Synthesis patterns.
2. **Synthesis + Verification Layer**: generate candidate automations and validate them in deterministic sandboxes.
3. **Approval + Deployment Layer**: add policy/owner approval flows and controlled promotion into orchestration targets.
4. **Runtime Intelligence Layer**: add observability, anomaly detection, and rollback workflows for deployed automations.

Explicit out-of-scope boundaries for initial versions:
- not a replacement for core repository intelligence and remediation priorities
- no autonomous direct repository writes outside `verify -> plan -> apply` policy controls
- no vendor-locked orchestration dependency as a required default
- no fully hands-off self-modifying automation runtime without human approval

## Rule: Product State Must Be Anchored

When a new command or major workflow ships, update the authoritative product-state surfaces in the same change (or immediately after):

- `README.md`
- `docs/PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`
- command reference docs
- demo docs/contracts
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

Pattern: **AI Anchor Drift**.

Command-state rule for current roadmap framing:

- New command additions must update README, roadmap, command reference, demo docs, and changelog.
- `index` and the AI repository-intelligence surface are implemented; roadmap items should track enhancement quality and automation durability rather than command existence.
- When docs and implementation disagree, code is source of truth.

## Phase: Command Validation Automation & Self-Verifying Development Loop

Goal:
Make Playbook command development self-verifying so new commands are validated deterministically as they are added.

Why this matters:
Playbook is building an AI-operable CLI surface. That surface becomes much more trustworthy when every command addition expands both product capability and automated validation coverage.

Development loop target:
1. implement command
2. add/update command contract tests
3. run deterministic validation
4. fix regressions before merge

Required validation surfaces for new commands:
- contract tests for deterministic JSON/text behavior where applicable
- smoke coverage for runtime execution paths
- local built CLI validation inside the Playbook repo
- docs and command-inventory updates in the same change

Codex-aligned workflow:
- Codex should not stop at implementation
- Codex should also add or update contract tests, run validation commands, and remediate failures before completion

Baseline validation commands:
- `pnpm -r build`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm smoke:ci`
- branch-accurate CLI runs through `node packages/cli/dist/main.js ...`

Pattern: Self-Verifying Command Development
- Every new command should increase both feature coverage and validation coverage.

Rule: Command Additions Must Ship With Validation
- A new command is not complete until its deterministic behavior is exercised by automated tests or smoke coverage.

Pattern: Branch-Accurate Command Validation
- Inside the Playbook repository, command validation should run against the locally built CLI entrypoint rather than assuming published package behavior.

Future enhancement:
- introduce `playbook self-test` as a system-level validation entrypoint that exercises key commands and contracts against fixture repositories.

## Documentation governance contract

- Deliver deterministic documentation governance through `playbook docs audit` for humans, CI, and AI.
- Maintain a single strategic roadmap (`docs/PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`) and separate improvements backlog (`docs/PLAYBOOK_IMPROVEMENTS.md`).
- Keep cleanup/migration guidance out of long-lived policy docs once governance is command-enforced.


## Security Contracts

- Added machine-readable security contracts to map runtime guards to deterministic enforcement tests.
- Added contract-driven security verification stage (`pnpm test:security`) for CI regression protection.
