# Remediation Trust Model

Remediation features require defined trust boundaries and change-scope levels.

## Scope

This model governs `pnpm playbook verify`, `pnpm playbook plan`, and `pnpm playbook apply` execution boundaries.

## Trust boundary principles

- `verify`: read-only analysis and policy evaluation.
- `plan`: deterministic proposal generation from failures; no repository mutation.
- `apply`: bounded executor that may mutate repository content only through approved plan tasks.

## Change levels

### Level 0 — Read-only analysis

- Commands: `verify`, `analyze`, `query`, `explain`, `ask`, `rules`, `docs audit`
- Allowed actions: inspect repository state and emit diagnostics
- Forbidden actions: file mutation

### Level 1 — Docs/tests/generated artifacts

- Commands: bounded `apply` tasks that modify docs, tests, or generated runtime artifacts
- Examples: update `.gitignore` artifact entries, regenerate `.playbook` runtime artifacts
- Risk profile: low, broadly reversible

### Level 2 — Scoped module code changes

- Commands: future deterministic auto-fixes limited to one owned module boundary
- Requirements: explicit rule mapping, deterministic patch shape, contract tests
- Risk profile: medium

### Level 3 — Cross-module or security-sensitive changes

- Commands: never auto-applied by default
- Requirements: explicit human review and out-of-band approval gates
- Risk profile: high

## Enforcement expectations

- Plans must classify each task with explicit change-level metadata.
- `apply` must reject tasks above configured trust level unless an explicit override contract exists.
- JSON contracts should keep change-level intent machine-readable for CI/auditors.

## Safety baseline

Default safety posture:

- Read-only and Level 1 automation allowed under deterministic policy controls.
- Level 2+ requires stronger scope constraints and human-reviewed rollout.
- Level 3 remains advisory-only in default Playbook operation.


## Diagnosis-before-repair test governance

Contract snapshot hardening reinforced a core remediation boundary: isolate diagnosis from repair. When fixtures were split so each contract test owned its own inputs, they exposed hidden producer/consumer dependencies that earlier shared fixture state had been masking.

- `test-triage` belongs on the diagnosis side of the boundary: classify failure shape first, then plan repair.
- `test-fix-plan` is the bounded bridge artifact: it may only convert pre-approved low-risk diagnosis classes into apply-compatible tasks with preserved provenance.
- Merge-time automation must not paper over missing prerequisite artifacts by mutating repo state blindly.
- Consumer commands and snapshot tests should declare prerequisite artifact producers explicitly instead of relying on prior command side effects.

Rule: isolated contract fixtures force hidden producer/consumer dependencies into the open.
Pattern: contract snapshots work best when every consumer command declares its prerequisite artifact producers explicitly.
Failure Mode: shared fixture state makes snapshots look stable while silently depending on prior command side effects.
