# Playbook Architecture

This document describes **current-state architecture**. Future-state initiatives live in [PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](./PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md).

## System layering

Playbook is organized as a layered monorepo:

- **`packages/cli`**: command parsing, output rendering, and exit codes.
- **`packages/engine`**: deterministic analysis, verification, plan generation, and fix execution.
- **`packages/node`**: Node/runtime adapter utilities used by CLI and engine integration points.
- **`packages/core`**: shared core contracts/utilities retained for package compatibility.

Primary flow:

`CLI -> engine (+ node adapter) -> repository`

## Canonical integration model: shared core, local intelligence

Playbook has two distinct architecture surfaces that must not be conflated:

1. **Playbook core product (shared engine):** the reusable CLI + engine + contracts shipped by the Playbook project.
2. **Consumer-repo integration (project-local Playbook state):** repository-local configuration, intelligence artifacts, plans, and optional extensions generated/owned by the consuming repository.

Rule: **Installing Playbook into another repository creates project-local Playbook state, not a Playbook fork by default.**

Project-local Playbook state typically includes:

- `playbook.config.json` (or `.playbook/config.json`) for local policy/configuration.
- `.playbook/repo-index.json` and other generated intelligence artifacts.
- `.playbook/plan.json` and similar remediation artifacts.
- repository-specific rules/extensions used by that repository.

Playbook core remains shared; repository-local state remains owned by the consuming project.

## Promotion boundary: local observations vs upstream product learnings

Playbook intentionally separates repository observations from core product evolution.

- **Local by default:** project-specific findings, architectural context, and rule outcomes stay in the consumer repository.
- **No hidden upstream mutation:** local command execution must not automatically mutate Playbook core.
- **Intentional upstream promotion:** generalized patterns, reusable rules, and product-level gaps should be promoted upstream deliberately through docs/roadmap/rule proposals and reviewed implementation.

Failure mode to avoid: treating project-specific customization as a core fork, which creates drift, duplicate fixes, and unclear ownership.

Preferred extension strategy for consuming repositories:

- configuration and policy tuning
- plugin-style extension points (as available)
- repository rule packs

Pattern: **prefer config/plugins/rule packs over core forks** unless a fork is unavoidable.

## Privacy and trust model

Playbook operates as **private-first by default**:

- scanning/indexing happens locally in the repository context
- generated artifacts remain local unless users explicitly export/share them
- no automatic upstream code/content export is implied by standard command usage

Any future export, sync, telemetry, or cloud-backed intelligence behavior must be explicit and opt-in.

## CLI command architecture

- CLI command handlers live in `packages/cli/src/commands/`.
- `packages/cli/src/commands/index.ts` is the central command registry and dispatch surface.
- Shared CLI helpers live in `packages/cli/src/lib/`.
- Engine behavior and rule execution logic should stay in `packages/engine`, not command files.

This separation keeps command modules thin and keeps governance logic reusable/testable.

## Analyze -> verify -> plan -> apply flow

Playbook governance execution follows a staged flow:

1. **`analyze`** detects repository structure and stack signals.
2. **`verify`** executes deterministic governance rules and returns findings.
3. **`plan`** converts verify failures into ordered, machine-safe tasks.
4. **`apply`** executes deterministic auto-fixable tasks from a generated plan.

`fix` remains available as a convenience command for direct local remediation flows, but the canonical machine-safe execution path is `plan -> apply`.

`plan` and `apply` are the machine-safe planning/execution path for remediation.

## Deterministic task and output contracts

The plan/execution pipeline is deterministic by contract:

- Verify findings are sorted before task generation.
- Task fields are stable (`ruleId`, `file`, `action`, `autoFix`).
- Nullable values are normalized (`file: null` when evidence is absent).
- JSON responses are structured for automation, not best-effort prose parsing.

Deterministic JSON output is treated as a public interface for CI, tooling, and agents.


## Safe Repository Mutation Model

Playbook provides a deterministic mutation engine with built-in safety guarantees for repository changes. Repository content is always treated as untrusted input, and policy enforcement occurs before any mutation is allowed.

Core guardrails in the mutation engine:

- **Repo Root Security Boundary**: all reads and writes must resolve within the repository root.
- **Remediation Plan Validation**: plans are schema-validated and invariant-checked before execution.
- **Evidence-Linked Plans**: each task must map back to deterministic findings and file-level evidence.
- **Secret Redaction in Logs**: execution and diagnostic logs must avoid leaking secrets or sensitive values.
- **CI Artifact Verification**: automation flows verify remediation artifacts and command contracts in CI.
- **Signed Supply Chain Artifacts**: release and security artifacts are signed and verifiable for provenance integrity.

The engine enforces policy gates before `apply`, ensuring that only approved and validated plan tasks can mutate repository state.

## Future Direction: Playbook Agents

Playbook's `verify -> plan -> apply` architecture is intentionally designed to enable safe integration with automated agents over time.

Conceptual control flow:

AI reasoning layer
↓
Playbook query/analysis layer
↓
Playbook remediation planning
↓
policy validation
↓
controlled apply execution

Agents should never write directly to the repository. All mutations must pass through the Playbook remediation pipeline so changes remain deterministic, reviewable, and policy-enforced.

## Future direction: embeddable runtime/API for app-integrated actions

For internal dashboards, CI control planes, admin panels, and product-integrated tooling, Playbook should expose server-side/library integration surfaces over time.

Design direction:

- expose validated server-side actions for capabilities such as `index`, `query`, `ask`, `explain`, and remediation orchestration
- keep repository mutations behind policy-checked server/runtime boundaries
- avoid browser-side arbitrary command execution as the default integration path

Pattern: app-integrated Playbook actions should call a **server-side API/runtime** (or trusted library surface) rather than executing raw CLI commands directly from browser clients.

## Rule: Playbook Analyzes but Does Not Author

Playbook provides structured analysis, diagnostics, and recommendations about repository state and development workflows.

Playbook does **not rewrite developer intent or author pull requests automatically**.

Its role is to provide architecture intelligence that informs developers rather than replacing developer judgment.
