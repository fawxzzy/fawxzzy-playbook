PLAYBOOK – 12 MONTH PRODUCT ROADMAP

AI Governance for Software Engineering

MISSION

Build the governance layer for AI-assisted software development.

Playbook ensures that AI-generated code:

follows architecture

captures engineering knowledge

maintains documentation discipline

prevents architectural drift

Playbook sits between AI coding agents and repositories.

AI Agents
     ↓
Playbook
     ↓
Repository
CORE PRINCIPLES

These rules guide all development decisions.

1️⃣ CLI First

Playbook must always function:

locally

offline

inside CI

Cloud must never be required.

playbook init
playbook analyze
playbook verify

must always work independently.

2️⃣ Deterministic Governance

Rules must be:

explicit

predictable

CI-friendly

Avoid "AI guessing" for core enforcement.

3️⃣ Knowledge Capture

Every meaningful engineering change must produce knowledge.

Example pipeline:

Code change
      ↓
Playbook Notes
      ↓
Proposed Doctrine
      ↓
Promoted Engineering Knowledge
4️⃣ Developer Experience Over Features

Adoption depends on:

Install
Run
Understand
Trust

within 5 minutes.

PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE

Playbook evolves through three layers.

AI-Aware Engineering Guardrails

AI code generation increases the need for automated verification and architectural guardrails.

Playbook is not a testing framework. It is the governance and verification layer that keeps AI-accelerated development from degrading architectural integrity.

Future capabilities:

AI-Safe Development
- Detect structural risks introduced by AI-generated code.
- Verify repository contracts remain intact after automated code generation.
- Ensure architectural boundaries remain respected.

Test Intelligence
- Detect modules without tests.
- Warn when critical subsystems lack integration tests.
- Surface test coverage gaps through future integrations with coverage tools.

Verification-First CI
- Expand `playbook verify` to support stronger enforcement in CI pipelines.
- Allow teams to fail builds on governance violations.
- Add future GitHub Action support for running `playbook verify` in CI.

Architectural Contracts
- Define repository invariants such as forbidden import paths, layer boundaries, and module ownership.
- Verify these contracts automatically during analysis and verification workflows.

Progress (current)

- [ ] AI-safe structural risk detection for generated code
- [ ] Repository contract verification for automated code generation workflows
- [ ] Test-intelligence signals for missing tests and integration coverage blind spots
- [ ] CI enforcement controls for governance-based build failures
- [ ] Built-in architectural contract definitions (imports, boundaries, ownership)
- [ ] GitHub Action support for verification-first governance in CI
Repository Templates

playbook init generates:

docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md
docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md
docs/PLAYBOOK_CHECKLIST.md
playbook.config.json
.github/workflows/playbook-verify.yml
CI Integration

Example:

run: playbook verify

CI fails if governance rules are violated.

Tooling & Distribution (Package Manager + Action + Demo Repo)

- [ ] Adopt pnpm as the workspace standard; keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` committed and never gitignored.
- [x] Enforce a single pnpm version source via `package.json#packageManager`; CI setup must not pin a conflicting pnpm version (use aligned `pnpm/action-setup` or Corepack behavior).

Near-Term Productization Milestones

- [ ] Demo Repository (developer onboarding): add `examples/demo-repo/` so developers can immediately run `npx playbook analyze` and receive a meaningful report. The demo should intentionally include small architecture violations, documentation drift, and governance examples to show Playbook in action.
- [ ] GitHub Action Integration (CI-native adoption): deliver a first-class `uses: playbook/verify` path, with initial implementation via `.github/workflows/playbook-verify.yml`. Initial capabilities should include `playbook verify`, architecture contract checks, and governance rule checks.
- [ ] NPM Package Publishing (public adoption): publish Playbook as an installable CLI with support for `npx playbook analyze` and `npm install playbook-cli`, backed by an npm publishing pipeline, clear versioning strategy, and reliable CLI distribution.

Initial Rule

v0.1 rule:

requireNotesOnChanges

Meaning:

If code changes in:

src/**
app/**
server/**
supabase/**

then:

docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md

must also change.

Success Criteria
CLI works locally
CI integration works
Smoke tests pass
Repo polished and documented

Progress (current)

- [x] Repository architecture established (`packages/cli`, `packages/engine`, `templates/repo`, `docs`, `scripts`)
- [x] Platform architecture (core + adapters + CLI)
- [x] CLI scaffold implemented (`init`, `analyze`, `verify`, `doctor`)
- [x] Repository templates generated by `playbook init`
- [x] CI workflow included for verification
- [x] Initial rule `requireNotesOnChanges` implemented in engine
- [x] Smoke test script and automated tests are present
- [x] pnpm policy explicitly documented and enforced as the toolchain standard
- [x] pnpm version governance consolidated to `packageManager` as the authoritative source
- [ ] `examples/demo-repo/` ships as an onboarding path with intentional architecture/doc/governance drift and meaningful analysis output
- [ ] GitHub Action path finalized for `uses: playbook/verify` with verify + architecture + governance checks
- [ ] npm package distribution live with publish pipeline, versioning strategy, and installable Playbook CLI
PHASE 2 — REPOSITORY INTELLIGENCE

Enterprise interest begins
Early design partners
FUTURE DIRECTION — PLAYBOOK PLATFORM VISION

Playbook starts as a CLI-first developer tool, but the platform is intentionally architected so the same analysis engine can power multiple product surfaces.

Architecture Philosophy

packages/engine is the core analysis engine.

Interfaces built on top of it can include:

CLI
GitHub Actions
API services
Web dashboards

This separation allows Playbook to grow from a local CLI workflow into a broader engineering governance platform without fragmenting core logic.

Potential Long-Term Capabilities

- Repository architecture graphs
- Engineering governance scoring
- Cross-repository insights
- Playbook Cloud dashboards
- AI-assisted repository explanation

LONG TERM VISION

Playbook becomes the governance infrastructure for AI-assisted development.

Equivalent ecosystem role:

Git → version control
CI → builds
Sentry → runtime errors
Playbook → architecture governance
NORTH STAR METRICS
