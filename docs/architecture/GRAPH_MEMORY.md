# Graph Memory Architecture

## Purpose

Playbook memory should be modeled as a deterministic heterogeneous graph.

Durable memory is not a bag of notes; it is a typed graph with preserved lineage and controlled contraction.

This document defines the structure layer only. It introduces graph-memory scaffolding without changing runtime behavior.

## Memory model

### Vertices

Vertices are memory-bearing entities:

- `RunCycle`
- `Artifact`
- `Zettel`
- `PatternCard`
- `Contract`
- `Subject`
- `Decision`

### Edges

Edges are typed relations between vertices:

- `PRODUCED`
- `CITES`
- `SUPPORTS`
- `DERIVES`
- `SIMILAR_TO`
- `MEMBER_OF`
- `PROMOTES_TO`
- `VIOLATES`
- `SUPERSEDES`
- `APPLIES_TO`

### Hypergraph-style relation modeling

Playbook uses a simple graph as the base representation.

When one relation needs more than two participants, model it as a relation vertex (hyperedge-style node) with:

- `relationKind`
- `participantIds[]`
- `evidenceRefs[]`
- `originCycleId`

This preserves deterministic storage while allowing multi-entity evidence/event relations.

## Contraction and attractors

- Contraction is memory compaction from many evidence vertices into fewer stable attractor vertices.
- Pattern cards are soft attractors.
- Contracts are hard attractors.

Why this matters:

- Accumulation is not compression. More notes can increase retrieval burden and entropy.
- Contraction must preserve lineage so every promoted claim remains traceable to evidence.
- Contracts are hard attractors because they carry governance invariants and policy force.

## Deterministic critical path vs exploratory analysis

Deterministic production grouping should be favored in the critical path:

- deterministic grouping: typed edges, reproducible thresholds, stable outputs
- deterministic WCC-style grouping: production-safe component formation

Stochastic clustering is exploratory only:

- offline Louvain/Leiden may be used for research and diagnostics
- exploratory clustering must not gate production promotion/contract decisions

## Current maturity stage

Shipped scaffolding currently covers:

- RunCycle lineage capture
- zettelkasten extraction (`zettels.jsonl`, `links.jsonl`)
- graph snapshots
- deterministic grouping

The next phase is implementation of deterministic candidate-pattern synthesis into draft pattern cards, plus promotion-readiness scoring.

Current scope stops before auto-promotion.

## Pipeline model

```text
raw artifacts
-> zettels
-> graph snapshot
-> deterministic groups
-> candidate patterns
-> draft pattern cards
-> review queue
-> promoted patterns
-> contracts
```

## Reasoning-engine lifecycle mapping

Graph memory is the structural core of Playbook's reasoning-engine lifecycle:

`evidence -> zettels -> graph -> groups -> candidate patterns -> draft pattern cards -> promotion decisions -> contracts`

- `evidence -> zettels`: converts deterministic findings into atomic, linked working-memory units
- `zettels -> graph`: anchors notes in typed relationship structure for replayable retrieval
- `graph -> groups`: derives deterministic cohesion groups that preserve lineage
- `groups -> candidate patterns -> draft pattern cards`: synthesizes reviewable abstractions without skipping evidence traceability
- `draft pattern cards -> promotion decisions -> contracts`: applies explicit governance morphisms before doctrine gains policy force

This keeps graph memory implementation-oriented: it is not passive storage, it is the compression and governance substrate for durable knowledge.

## Temperature model

```text
hot graph -> warm graph -> cold graph
```

- hot graph = current cycle working set
- warm graph = unresolved/converging memory
- cold graph = promoted doctrine/contracts

## Rule / Pattern / Failure Mode

Rule:
Do not promote grouped knowledge until it is rendered into reviewable draft pattern cards.

Pattern:
Playbook memory matures through explicit compression boundaries, not hidden jumps.

Failure Mode:
A system that can group memory but not review it will either stall or over-promote.


Rule:
Durable knowledge must pass through an explicit promotion decision.

Pattern:
Pattern-card promotion forms the durable attractors of Playbook memory.

Failure Mode:
Unreviewed pattern promotion creates unstable doctrine and architecture drift.

## Runtime artifacts

Current runtime graph-memory artifacts are emitted per run cycle:

- `.playbook/graph/groups/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`
- `.playbook/compaction/candidate-patterns/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`

Next-phase artifacts (not auto-promotion):

- `.playbook/pattern-cards/drafts/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`
- `.playbook/promotion/review-queue/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`
- `.playbook/promotion/decisions/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`
- `.playbook/pattern-cards/promoted/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`

Grouping metrics include:

- `componentCount`
- `singletonComponentCount`
- `largestComponentSize`
- `avgComponentSize`
- `groupableZettelCount`
- `candidatePatternCount`
- `contractionRatio`
- `orphanRate`
- `boundaryConflictCount`
- `crossContractConflictCount`


Rule:
Do not promote compressed knowledge until deterministic grouping and lineage-preserving contraction exist.

Pattern:
Playbook memory matures in stages: atomic capture, structural linkage, deterministic grouping, then controlled compression.

Failure Mode:
Skipping grouping and jumping straight from notes to doctrine causes brittle, non-reproducible promotion.

## Next-phase acceptance criteria

- Candidate patterns are deterministically synthesized from grouped evidence.
- Each draft pattern card preserves lineage to source zettels and origin run cycles.
- Promotion-readiness scoring is reproducible and emitted with draft artifacts.
- Promotion remains review-gated; no automatic promotion to contracts.

## Decision morphisms

- **Rule:** No knowledge state may be mutated in place; durable state changes must be explicit decision morphisms.
- **Pattern:** Promotion decisions are graph morphisms from input pattern-state objects to resulting pattern-state objects.
- **Failure Mode:** Without append-only morphism journals, graph memory cannot be replayed or rolled back deterministically.

Rule:
Contracts evolve only through verified mutation proposals.

Pattern:
Pattern promotion feeds contract proposals, not direct contract mutation.

Failure Mode:
Direct mutation of contracts breaks deterministic governance.

## Pattern topology equivalence

Promoted pattern cards now support deterministic topology signatures so structurally equivalent patterns can be collapsed into canonical equivalence classes without deleting historical variants.

Topology signatures are computed from deterministic invariants only:

- stage count
- dependency structure
- contract references
- invariant type
- mechanism type

Equivalence artifacts are emitted under:

- `.playbook/topology/equivalence/<timestamp>@<shortsha>.json`

Rule:
Canonical doctrine must represent each structural idea exactly once.

Pattern:
Topology compression reduces pattern-level redundancy.

Failure Mode:
Multiple canonical patterns representing the same structure create doctrine fragmentation.
