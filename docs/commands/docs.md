# `pnpm playbook docs audit`

`pnpm playbook docs audit` validates Playbook documentation governance with deterministic guardrails for the active docs canon.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm playbook docs audit
pnpm playbook docs audit --json
pnpm playbook docs audit --ci --json
```

## Checks

1. Canonical required-anchor checks for current active docs and roadmap/archive anchors.
2. Single-roadmap and planning-surface governance (planning language stays on approved planning surfaces).
3. Active-surface package/install consistency (`@fawxzzy/playbook` and no unscoped/legacy package examples).
4. Active-surface legacy-link detection for superseded compatibility-stub doc paths.
5. Front-door canonical-ladder drift checks (`ai-context -> ai-contract -> context -> index/query/explain/ask --repo-context -> verify -> plan -> apply -> verify`) with `analyze` treated as compatibility/lightweight.
6. Archive and compatibility-stub hygiene (general archive naming conventions, intentional redirect stubs, and cleanup-candidate reporting for ad hoc trackers).

## CI behavior

- `--ci` exits non-zero when any `error` findings are present.
- `warning` findings are reported but non-blocking.

## Governance patterns

- Pattern: Documentation architecture is an executable contract enforced by Playbook commands.
- Rule: Active docs must describe the deterministic runtime/trust-layer model and the scoped public package surface.
- Rule: Compatibility stubs and archive/history docs are intentionally preserved but excluded from active-surface drift checks.
- Failure Mode: Active-surface drift occurs when front-door docs regress to legacy package examples, superseded doc links, or analyze-first serious-user workflows.
