# Cognitive Dynamics Framework v0.1

## Purpose

This research document formalizes Cognitive Dynamics Framework v0.1 as a doctrine-level model for reasoning about how repository signals are perceived, compressed, stabilized, and revised over time.

This is **research doctrine**, not a claim of current runtime implementation.

## When to use this framework

Use this framework when you need to:

- explain why two operators can read the same repository evidence but make different decisions,
- design docs/policy surfaces that reduce interpretation drift,
- assess whether a pattern/rule proposal is robust across changing repository state,
- distinguish deterministic runtime truth from cognitive or social interpretation layers.

Do not use this framework as a replacement for command truth or governance contracts.

## Primitives

The framework uses five primitives:

1. **Signal**: repository-observable evidence (artifacts, diffs, outputs, graph changes).
2. **Compression**: abstraction of repeated signals into compact forms (motifs, summaries, rules, patterns).
3. **Stabilizer**: governance and reuse loops that preserve a compression over time.
4. **Perturbation**: new evidence that challenges an existing compression.
5. **Recalibration**: explicit adjustment, split, or retirement of prior compression.

## Boundary conditions

The framework operates under these boundaries:

- deterministic command output remains source-of-truth for repository state,
- cognitive models are interpretive overlays and must remain traceable to evidence,
- promoted doctrine requires reviewable provenance and explicit governance surfaces,
- frameworks may guide decisions but must not silently mutate canonical artifacts.

## Axioms

1. Interpretation follows structure but is not identical to structure.
2. Compression reduces decision cost and may reduce context fidelity.
3. Stabilization without periodic perturbation checks produces drift risk.
4. Governance quality is measured by revision capability, not permanence.
5. The reliability of symbolic language depends on explicit links to evidence.

## Notation

Use the following notation for discussion and reviews:

- `S_t`: signal set observed at time `t`.
- `C_t = compress(S_t)`: compression formed from current signals.
- `G(C_t)`: governance stabilizer acting on compression.
- `P_t`: perturbation arriving at time `t`.
- `R(C_t, P_t) -> C_(t+1)`: recalibration function updating compression after perturbation.

This notation is conceptual and should be treated as explanatory shorthand.

## Order/chaos mapping

Cognitive dynamics can be mapped along an order-to-chaos continuum:

- **Ordered zone**: high signal consistency, stable compression, low reinterpretation cost.
- **Adaptive zone**: bounded perturbations trigger controlled recalibration and healthy learning.
- **Chaotic zone**: unresolved perturbations, conflicting compressions, and unstable language.

Operational implication:

- ordered systems optimize predictability,
- adaptive systems optimize resilience,
- chaotic systems require boundary re-establishment before additional abstraction.

## Non-goals

- Defining new runtime engine behavior.
- Replacing `verify -> plan -> apply -> verify` with cognitive theory steps.
- Treating conceptual notation as executable contract logic.
- Making truth claims that bypass command/artifact evidence.

## Governance labels

Pattern: `Signal -> Compression -> Stabilization -> Perturbation -> Recalibration` is the preferred analysis path for interpretation-quality discussions.

Rule: Cognitive framing must remain subordinate to deterministic command truth and explicit governance artifacts.

Failure Mode: Cognitive drift occurs when stabilized language persists after contradictory repository evidence and no recalibration is performed.
