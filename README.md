Playbook is a governance CLI for repositories that keeps checks deterministic for both humans and AI agents. It helps teams inspect current policy status, understand active rules, and apply safe fixes with confidence.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx playbook status
npx playbook rules
npx playbook explain <ruleId>
# optional:
npx playbook plan
npx playbook apply
npx playbook apply --from-plan .playbook/plan.json
npx playbook fix --yes
npx playbook upgrade
npx playbook --help
```

## How to discover capabilities

The CLI help output is the authoritative source for supported commands and flags.

- Use `playbook rules` to list available rules.
- Use `playbook explain <id>` to see what a rule checks and how to remediate findings.

## Init Scaffold Contract

Running:

```bash
npx playbook init
```

guarantees the following baseline project artifacts:

- Playbook configuration (`playbook.config.json` or `.playbook/config.json`)
- `docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md`

Other documentation such as `docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md` may be present depending on repository governance policies, but it is not required by the default scaffold.
