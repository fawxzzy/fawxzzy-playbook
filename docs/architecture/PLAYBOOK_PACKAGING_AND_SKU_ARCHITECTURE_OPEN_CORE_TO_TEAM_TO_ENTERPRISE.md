# Playbook Packaging and SKU Architecture: Open Core to Team to Enterprise

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical Packaging / SKU Architecture for Playbook.

It ensures packaging follows the existing deterministic architecture and governance model so Open Core, Team, and Enterprise remain one product with one runtime truth.

Document role in the broader product story:

- Product roadmap owns strategic direction: `docs/PLAYBOOK_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`.
- Business strategy owns GTM and monetization sequencing: `docs/PLAYBOOK_BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md`.
- This document owns SKU boundaries and deployment packaging invariants.

Pattern: Packaging Follows Architecture.
Pattern: Open Core for Trust, Paid Layers for Coordination and Governance.
Pattern: Same Runtime, Different Operational Surfaces.
Rule: SKU boundaries must not change core runtime semantics.
Rule: Cloud must remain optional.
Rule: Paid packaging monetizes coordination and governance scale, not basic deterministic trust.
Rule: Enterprise deployment choice must preserve the same governance semantics.
Failure Mode: Cloud-first fork of the product.
Failure Mode: Free tier too weak to prove deterministic value.
Failure Mode: SKU-specific truth models.
Failure Mode: Monetizing trust primitives instead of monetizing coordination pain.
Failure Mode: Hosted product becoming the only real product.

## Core doctrine

Playbook packaging must follow architecture, not redefine it.

- **Playbook Core** remains the deterministic shared runtime across all SKUs.
- **Repo-local/project-local Playbook state** (`.playbook/*`) remains foundational.
- **Paid layers** package coordination, governance, deployment, and operational trust surfaces around the same runtime.
- **Deployment model and SKU** must never redefine engine semantics.

Canonical runtime doctrine:

`same runtime -> same verify trust boundary -> same session/evidence provenance -> different coordination/operations packaging by SKU`

## Canonical SKU ladder

1. **Open Core / Free**
2. **Team**
3. **Enterprise**

## Open Core / Free

Open Core is the trust and activation surface that proves deterministic value locally.

Includes:

- local deterministic CLI workflows (`context/query/explain/verify/plan/apply`)
- core repository intelligence + governance + safe remediation loop
- core docs/governance scaffolding and alignment workflows
- single-repo or local-first adoption surface
- no cloud requirement; local/offline usage remains first-class

Open Core is optimized for habit formation, trust, and activation. It must remain strong enough to demonstrate real deterministic value without requiring hosted coordination layers.

## Team

Team packages shared coordination over multiple repositories and collaborators while preserving per-repo ownership and deterministic runtime truth.

Includes directional team surfaces:

- hosted/shared coordination layer over multiple repos and collaborators
- shared repository intelligence views
- team policies and shared rulesets
- pull request annotations/checks
- remediation history and change tracking
- multi-repo visibility and dashboards
- team reporting and governance analytics direction
- per-repo evidence drill-down and local ownership boundary preservation

Team is where monetization begins by reducing coordination pain and increasing governance reliability at team scale.

## Enterprise

Enterprise packages organization-grade governance, deployment controls, and operational trust guarantees over the same deterministic runtime.

Includes directional enterprise surfaces:

- org/tenant governance
- SSO/RBAC direction
- audit logs and approval controls
- compliance/policy packs
- self-hosted / VPC / boundary-controlled deployment options
- rollout/governance onboarding/support packaging
- stronger operational guarantees without changing engine truth

Enterprise value is governance depth, auditability, and boundary-controlled operations, not alternate runtime semantics.

## SKU-to-architecture mapping

- **Open Core** maps primarily to Playbook CLI + deterministic local runtime.
- **Team** maps to governance/control-plane coordination and optional hosted surfaces.
- **Enterprise** maps to tenant governance, deployment choice, auditability, and enterprise trust requirements.
- **All SKUs** route through the same session/evidence/control-plane semantics.

Architecture dependency references:

- `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_CONTROL_PLANE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_GOVERNED_INTERFACE_API_SURFACES_FOR_MULTI_REPO_CONTROL_PLANES.md`
- `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_WORKSPACE_TENANT_GOVERNANCE_AND_OPTIONAL_HOSTED_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Cross-SKU invariants (must stay consistent)

The following are non-negotiable across Open Core, Team, and Enterprise:

- deterministic reasoning/runtime semantics
- `verify` as canonical trust boundary
- session/evidence provenance expectations
- private-first and explicit opt-in export principles
- per-repo local ownership and project-local state
- thin interfaces over one canonical runtime

If a packaging decision violates these invariants, packaging is wrong.

## What remains core vs what is monetized

### Core (must remain shared and usable locally)

- deterministic local CLI/runtime
- core repository intelligence
- core governance verification
- core safe remediation workflow

### Team/Enterprise monetization surfaces

- coordination
- shared visibility
- governance workflows
- approvals/auditability
- hosted control-plane packaging
- enterprise deployment and trust controls

Monetization should scale with organizational coordination and governance complexity, not by degrading baseline deterministic trust.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Crippling the free/open product so it no longer proves deterministic value.
- Making cloud the real product and CLI a thin teaser.
- Introducing SKU-specific engine semantics.
- Hiding provenance/auditability behind enterprise-only “truth”.
- Monetizing basic trust primitives instead of monetizing coordination/governance scale.
- Forcing source upload or hidden telemetry for paid packaging.

## Packaging boundaries and deployment models

- Local-only operation remains valid regardless of SKU strategy.
- Team may use hosted coordination surfaces.
- Enterprise may use hosted or self-hosted/boundary-controlled deployment.
- Deployment choice affects operational packaging, not core governance semantics.

Deployment references:

- `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_WORKSPACE_TENANT_GOVERNANCE_AND_OPTIONAL_HOSTED_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/CONSUMER_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md`

## Expected upgrade path

1. **Solo/Open adoption** proves local deterministic value.
2. **Team upgrade** occurs when coordination pain and multi-repo governance emerge.
3. **Enterprise upgrade** occurs when auditability, approvals, RBAC, compliance, and deployment boundaries matter.

Services can support early discovery and onboarding but must not become the primary product moat.

## Product identity guardrails

- Do not reposition Playbook as a generic AI coding assistant product.
- Do not weaken CLI-first, offline-capable, or private-first principles.
- Do not introduce hidden telemetry, automatic source upload, or cloud-required behavior.
- Do not present Team/Enterprise as different core engines.
- Do not collapse per-repo boundaries in the name of packaging simplicity.
