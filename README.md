# Playbook

AI-aware engineering governance for modern repositories.

## Keywords

Playbook is related to:

- AI engineering governance
- repository analysis
- developer tooling
- AI coding agent guardrails
- engineering architecture contracts
- documentation governance
- CLI developer tools

## What Playbook Does

Playbook analyzes a repository and enforces engineering governance such as architecture contracts, documentation discipline, and AI-agent guardrails.

Core commands:

- `playbook init`
- `playbook analyze`
- `playbook verify`

## Why Playbook Exists

Modern repositories are complex and often lack enforceable engineering governance.

Playbook introduces machine-readable governance rules so both humans and AI coding agents can safely modify large codebases without architectural drift.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx playbook init
npx playbook analyze
npx playbook verify
```

- `playbook init` scaffolds governance docs and configuration in your repository.
- `playbook analyze` detects repository stack signals and produces architecture guidance.
- `playbook verify` runs deterministic governance checks for CI and local development.

## Development

Install:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Lint:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Build:

```bash
pnpm -r build
```

Test:

```bash
pnpm -r test
```

Smoke (recommended):

```bash
pnpm smoke
```

## CI

- CI runs the Playbook composite action at `.github/actions/playbook-ci`.
- CI runs: install → lint → build → test → smoke.
- CI is strict: missing CLI dist output fails smoke checks, and install must pass with a frozen lockfile.
- If `pnpm install` fails due to proxy/network runner constraints, reproduce locally or fix runner networking rather than weakening CI guarantees.

## Example Output

```text
$ npx playbook analyze
Detected Stack

Framework: Next.js
Database: Supabase
Styling: Tailwind
```

```text
$ npx playbook verify
PASS  requireNotesOnChanges
All governance checks passed.
```

## How It Works

Playbook treats repository governance as machine-readable contracts. Rules are explicit, deterministic, and designed to run locally, offline, and in CI.

## Project Structure

- `/packages` — monorepo packages for the Playbook CLI and governance engine.
- `/docs` — product, architecture, governance, and contributor documentation.
- `/scripts` — development and maintenance scripts for this repository.
- `/Playbook` — generated governance workspace in repositories initialized with Playbook templates.
