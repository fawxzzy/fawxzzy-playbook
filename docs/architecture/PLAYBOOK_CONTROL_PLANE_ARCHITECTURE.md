# Playbook Control Plane Architecture

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical **Control Plane** architecture layer for Playbook.

The control plane is the policy layer that determines:

- who can invoke actions
- what actions are allowed
- what evidence is required
- what approval level is required
- what mutation scope is allowed
- what adapters/integrations are allowed
- what data remains local vs what may be promoted/exported
- when execution must fail closed

It is dependency-ordered **after Session + Evidence** and **before broader orchestration/autonomy expansion**.

## Scope and positioning

Playbook remains CLI-first, offline-capable, private-first, and deterministic.

This architecture does **not** introduce a broad `playbook agent` command surface.

This architecture does **not** imply hidden telemetry, automatic source upload, or automatic upstream sync.

Pattern: Policy Follows Evidence.
Pattern: Control Plane Before Autonomy.
Rule: Verification remains the trust boundary.
Rule: Repo-local facts stay local unless intentionally promoted.
Rule: Ambiguous policy or incomplete verification must fail closed.
Failure Mode: Tool autonomy before policy boundaries.
Failure Mode: Session evidence without enforcement.
Failure Mode: Adapter-specific behavior leaking into core runtime.
Failure Mode: Memory/export behavior implied without explicit opt-in.

## Actor classes

The control plane evaluates policy by actor class:

1. **Human operator**
   - interactive local invocation and explicit review/approval actions.
2. **CI workflow**
   - non-interactive policy evaluation, verify gates, and bounded deterministic execution.
3. **Maintenance workflow**
   - scheduled/on-demand repository maintenance under explicit policy constraints.
4. **AI assistant**
   - assisted execution constrained to deterministic command contracts and policy gates.
5. **Future autonomous agent**
   - directional only; must inherit the same evidence, approval, and mutation constraints.

## Execution modes

Control-plane policy should classify execution by mode:

1. **Read-only intelligence**
   - index/query/explain/ask/context surfaces without repository mutation.
2. **Verify-only governance**
   - policy and rule evaluation without plan/apply mutation.
3. **Plan-only remediation**
   - deterministic planning and recommendation output without mutation.
4. **Approved apply**
   - mutation only after required evidence + approvals are present.
5. **Maintenance automation**
   - bounded repetitive maintenance flows under explicit policy profiles.
6. **Future synthesized automation**
   - directional mode where generated automation remains untrusted until verify + approvals pass.

## Mutation-scope taxonomy

Control-plane policy should assign every action a mutation scope level:

- **Level 0 — No mutation**
  - read/query/analysis only.
- **Level 1 — Local/docs/scaffold-safe mutation**
  - low-risk local docs/templates/scaffolding updates with bounded paths.
- **Level 2 — Bounded code/config mutation**
  - constrained source/config edits within declared module/path boundaries.
- **Level 3 — Cross-module or security-sensitive mutation**
  - broader impact changes, security-sensitive files, auth/policy/runtime-boundary edits.
- **Level 4 — External side effects / deployment / privileged automation**
  - external systems, deployment, privileged actions, or non-local side effects.

## Approval policy model

Approval policy is mutation-level and actor-aware:

- **Automatic policy allowance**
  - Level 0 and selected Level 1 actions may run automatically when policy + verification requirements are satisfied.
- **Explicit human approval required**
  - Level 2 actions require explicit human approval before mutation.
- **Owner/security approval required**
  - Level 3 and Level 4 actions require explicit owner/security approval.
- **Auditability invariant**
  - all approval decisions must be linked to session evidence and preserved in auditable records.

## Evidence and trust requirements

Control-plane policy must enforce:

- no privileged mutation without linked session evidence
- verification remains the trust boundary for mutation and promotion
- ambiguous/incomplete verification must fail closed
- promoted knowledge must preserve provenance

Session evidence should bind:

- actor identity/class
- command lineage
- findings and remediation rationale
- approval decision records
- resulting mutation artifacts

## Adapter and integration boundaries

To preserve deterministic core behavior:

- external adapters must remain deterministic, bounded, and policy-gated
- adapter-specific behavior must not leak into core engine behavior
- future MCP/API/integration surfaces must route through control-plane checks
- browser clients should use validated server/API surfaces, not arbitrary local command execution

Control plane evaluation should occur before adapter execution so policy remains centralized and portable across surfaces.

## Locality, promotion, and export rules

Default data posture:

- repo-local facts remain local by default
- reusable patterns may be intentionally promoted upstream
- export/sync remains explicit opt-in
- no hidden telemetry

No control-plane decision should imply automatic cross-repo memory transfer or implicit external publication.

## Fail-closed enforcement model

Execution must fail closed when:

- required policy inputs are missing or ambiguous
- required approvals are absent or unverifiable
- required evidence links are missing/stale/contradictory
- verification is incomplete or ambiguous for requested mutation scope
- adapter execution request exceeds allowed policy scope

Fail-closed behavior is mandatory for all privileged mutation and external side-effect pathways.

## Dependency ordering in platform architecture

Recommended dependency chain:

1. deterministic runtime (`verify -> plan -> apply` and intelligence artifacts)
2. session + evidence architecture
3. control plane architecture (policy, approvals, mutation boundaries, adapter boundaries, export rules)
4. review/orchestration hardening
5. future learning, synthesis, and autonomous surfaces

This sequence is architecture direction and roadmap sequencing guidance, not a claim that all layers are implemented.
