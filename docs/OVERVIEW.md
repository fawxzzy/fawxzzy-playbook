# Playbook Overview

Playbook is a governance tool for software repositories that are increasingly changed by both humans and AI coding agents.

Its purpose is simple: keep engineering standards enforceable, visible, and automated.

## Philosophy: AI-Aware Governance

Playbook treats governance as code. Teams define architecture and documentation expectations in machine-readable rules, then enforce those rules through local workflows and CI.

This keeps governance deterministic and auditable instead of relying on informal review habits.

## Why Structured Rules Matter for Agents

AI agents can ship code quickly, but speed increases risk when repository constraints are implicit. Without explicit rules, teams experience documentation drift, architectural erosion, and inconsistent implementation decisions.

Playbook gives repositories structured guardrails so agent-assisted changes stay aligned with engineering intent.
## Product positioning

Playbook is an AI-operable development tool:

- human-usable in local CLI workflows
- machine-readable through deterministic JSON contracts
- CI-enforceable with stable exit codes and policy checks
- agent-compatible through explicit command and rule surfaces
